# wants to change hard times
I've taken word lists from data leaks and breaches and added the passwords I've learned to this file. Please use them with caution. I'm not responsible for any loss or damage. I'll update this word list annually and share passwords I've learned from friends, girlfriends, coworkers, etc.
